All information from these archived files has been consolidated into:

- **README.md** - Project overview and quick start
- **TESTING.md** - Testing guidelines
- **TEST_FAILURES_ANALYSIS.md** - Current test status analysis

## Why These Were Archived

These documents were created during specific development sessions and contained:
- Temporary session notes
- Historical context that's now outdated
- Information that has been consolidated into main docs
- Duplicate content

They are kept for historical reference but are **NOT** part of the active documentation.

## When to Reference These Files

Reference these files only if you need to:
- Understand the history of a specific change
- See the reasoning behind architectural decisions
- Review what was changed during specific refactoring sessions
- Trace the evolution of the codebase

For current development, **always use the main documentation** in the root directory.
